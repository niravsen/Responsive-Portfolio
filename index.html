                                            Hello Hello Hello! My name is Nirav and I am really excited about the University of Toronto  bootcamp course. I am currently an IT Support Analyst at TD Securities Limited. I wanted to pursue taking this course to expedite my skills as I come from a limited background in IT. This course will help me in my current position, however I will be looking to be a full stack developer in the coming years.
                                            </br>
                                            </br>   
                                            In my spare time I enjoy reading and trying new foods. I love to travel and exploring new cities as the world is one big place that should be explored by everyone. I also enjoy discovering new music and attending concerts. 
                                            </br>
                                            </br> 
                                            I have a Bachelors in Fine Arts in Photography from Ontario College of Arts and Design, Recently I completed a certificate in User Experience Design and looking forward to completing this Boot camp course through UofT and acquiring a whole new skill set.
